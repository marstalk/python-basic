# covariance 协方差 /kəʊ'veərɪəns/
positive covariance
negative covariance
zero covariance
-   如果协方差为正，说明同向变化，越大，同向程度越高。
-   如果协方差为负，说明反向变化，越小，反向程度越高。
- Covariance: Measures the degree of simultaneous (same-direction) or opposite-direction changes.
-   If the covariance is positive, it indicates same-direction movement; the larger the value, the stronger the same-direction relationship.
-   If the covariance is negative, it indicates opposite-direction movement; the smaller the value, the stronger the opposite-direction relationship.

# correlation coefficient /ˌkɒrə'leɪʃ(ə)n/
- 相关系数： 衡量相似度程度，-1到1之间，越接近1，正相关程度越高，越接近-1，负相关程度越高。
-   如果相关系数为0，说明两者没有线性相关性。
-   如果相关系数为1，说明两者完全正相关。
-   如果相关系数为-1，说明两者完全负相关。
- Correlation Coefficient: Measures the degree of similarity, ranging from -1 to 1. The closer it is to 1, the stronger the positive correlation; the closer it is to -1, the stronger the negative correlation.
-   A correlation coefficient of 0 means no linear correlation between the two variables.
-   A correlation coefficient of 1 means a perfect positive correlation.
-   A correlation coefficient of -1 means a perfect negative correlation.

# coefficient 系数


# variance
to measure the "spread out" a group of number is. it shows how much the numbers differ from the average.
Like, if the variance of scores is very small, then the top rank of students differs from average is very small.
